## Overview

This repository contains an implemenation of `MemSight` based on `angr`. The ideas behind `MemSight` have been presented in the paper "Rethinking Pointer Reasoning in Symbolic Execution" accepted at ASE 2017.

- `explore.py`: main script, line-by-line exploration
- `run.py`: main script, non line-by-line exploration
- `executor.py`: a line-by-line executor (invoked by `explore.py` and `run.py`)
- `factory.py`: some functions to build different kinds of symbolic memories
- `executor_config.py`: parser for executor config
- `simple_fully_symbolic_memory.py`: an angr-like implementation of a fully symbolic memory
- `angr_symbolic_memory.py`: a wrapper around angr symbolic memory
- `naive_fully_symbolic_memory.py`: a naive implementation of a fully symbolic memory (see: [pseudocode/naive-v3](pseudocode/naive-v3/main.pdf))
- `range_fully_symbolic_memory.py`: MEMSIGHT (see: [pseudocode/naive-v3](pseudocode/naive-v4/main.pdf) and the ASE paper)
- `utils.py`: other useful stuff
- `pitree/`: page interval tree implementation
- `tests/`: testing binaries

## Requirements

This code works with `angr` 5.6.x. Check out the docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ercoppa/angr-fsm-0.1/) to get a working environment based on Ubuntu 16.04 with `MemSight` and the CGC binaries.

## How to run
Line-by-line symbolic execution can be started with:

    python explore.py tests/<path-to-binary>
    
Or (non line-by-line exploration):

    python run.py tests/<path-to-binary>

The implementation of the symbolic memory can be selected by adding a parameter when calling `run.py` or `explore.py`. For instance:

     python explore.py 0 <path-to-binary>

Accepted values:
- `0`: `simple_fully_symbolic_memory.py` (default)
- `1`: `angr_symbolic_memory.py`
- `2`: `naive_fully_symbolic_memory.py`
- `3`:  `MemSight` (ASE paper)
    
## Binary configuration
For each binary, a configuration script `<path-to-binary>.py` must exist. This script must define few python functions:

    def start():
      return <start_address>

    def end():
      return [<end_address>, ...]

    def avoid():
      return [<avoid_address>, ...]

    def do_start(state):
      # properly initialize the initial state
      return stuff

    def do_end(state, stuff):
      # this is called when one of end targets is reached
